# A/B Testing Portfolio: From Simulation to Real Impact
Welcome to the A/B Testing portfolio.
This repository documents my journey from learning the fundamentals through simulation to applying those skills on real datasets that drive business insights.
In other words, it's about mastering the logic behind it before analyzing its real-world complexity.
I've learned that A/B testing is one of the most essential tools in data science, whether for optimizing user experience, increasing revenue, or validating product decisions.
This repo shows how I approach experimentation with clarity, rigor, and reproducibility. It's not just statistical significance I was looking for, but practical significance and real impact.

### 1. Simulation: Learning the Core Concepts
Before touching real data, I built a fully controlled A/B test simulation to understand:

* How random assignment works

* How conversion and revenue metrics behave

* How to compute confidence intervals, and p‑values

* How sample size affects statistical power

* How to interpret results for business stakeholders
<br></br>

This simulation allowed me to practice the entire workflow, which included:

* Generating synthetic users

* Assigning them to control/variant

* Simulating conversions and revenue

* Running statistical tests

* Visualizing distributions
<br></br>

### 2. Real A/B Test: Revenue‑Based Experiment
After building confidence with simulation, I moved on to a real dataset containing:

* `USER_ID`

* `VARIANT_NAME `(control vs. variant)

* `REVENUE` per user


Key questions explored:
* Does the variant increase conversion rate?

* Does it increase average revenue per user (ARPU)?

* Does it increase average revenue per paying user (ARPPU)?

* Is the lift statistically significant?

* What business decision should follow?
